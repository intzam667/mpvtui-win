For documentation, refer to the original repo: https://github.com/intzam667/mpvtui/

## NOTE
Windows version might be a little buggy, especially when renaming videos. I do not plan to work on the Windows implementation since I don't use Windows myself. You can gladly fork and maintain it.

## Usage

Just download the latest release and run setup batch as administrator.<br>
To make Windows recognize the script, Path variable should be configured: <br>
Type into Windows search bar: "Edit the system environment variables" <br>

- Click Environment Variables <br>
- Find variable for "Path" <br>
- Click edit. <br>
- Finally click "New" <br>
- Add this as variable: <br>
%USERPROFILE%\Documents\mpvtui667 <br>

You have succesfully installed mpvtui to Documents folder. <br>
Open a new session and type "mpvtui" <br>

# Why not "mpvtui667" but "mpvtui"?

Because Windows binaries are static so I couldn't copy them to another folder with the 667 tag :(
